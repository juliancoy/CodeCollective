      <h1>Advancing Professionalism</h1>
      <p>
        Code Collective empowers local tech talent through 
        educational workshops, community-driven meetups, and advocacy 
        for change in the professional environment. We amplify the 
        voices of tech professionals, and likewise consider the needs of the 
        market. By bridging the gap between skilled professionals and employers 
        across public and private sectors, we strengthen the institutions around us. 
        Our approach combines professional development with collective decision making, 
        ensuring each talented professional not only finds their ideal 
        opportunity but also helps shape a more sensible tech ecosystem.
      </p>
      <h1 align="right">An Improved Hiring Pipeline</h1>
      <p>
        The hiring process of today is broken. Companies spend significant
        resources finding employees, but still seem to hire the wrong 
        people. Code Collective aims to improve the hiring pipeline
        by evaluating candidates in real development environments 
        before recommending them to employers. With a deeper
        understanding of the current tech landscape, we offer a more
        effective alternative to traditional staffing agencies.
      </p>
      <h1>Influential Projects</h1>
      <p>
        At Code Collective, we tackle a diverse range of projects that
        bridge technology and real-world impact. There are two major 
        projects underway; the Arkavo web forum and Baltimore ASI 
        (Artificial Super Intelligence). These projects are both 
        a means to develop local tech talent and of monumental importance
        in themselves.
