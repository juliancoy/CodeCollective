					<h2>Recap of Fall and Winter Events</h2>
					<img src="/images/version_control_basic/removebg/victoria-contrastfix.png" alt="Certificate Celebration">
					<p>
						Congratulations to Victoria Thomas for obtaining her Version Control Basic Proficiency
						Certificate, alongside five other students!
						This brief course got students more familiar with how to use Git to collaborate on high quality
						code.
					</p>

					<p>
						Since its foundation last Fall, Code Collective has been aggressively trying out a variety of
						event programs,
						with the intention of improving professionalism and computer labor quality.
						We began with some networking and targeted discussion on labor, alternating with development
						sessions on General AI in the Fall.
						This past Winter we hosted a series of workshops highlighting skills in Git, React, and Arduino.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="section">
					<h2>The Future of Code Collective</h2>
					<p>
						Looking forward, we will be focusing less on individual skills, and more on what steps can be
						taken to improve labor conditions
						for American developers of hardware and software products.
					</p>
					<p>
						As it stands, we are often overlooked in favor of inexpensive foreign labor because of the
						significant costs associated with
						hiring American workers. Furthermore, our reliance on Government Contracting positions has
						slowed down our pace both individually
						and collectively. Now with federal agencies experiencing budget cutbacks, the Baltimore
						Metropolitan area – a recognized hub for government tech contracting – could face significant shifts. Code Collective hopes to make this transition work in our advantage through petitions, alerts,
						and advocacy for USA Tech Workers.
					</p>

					<h2>Upcoming Events</h2>

					<h3>Tech Unity Cookout</h3>
					<img src="/images/techflag.png" alt="Tech Unity Cookout">
					<p>
						We would like to host a Tech Unity Cookout to bring together all the groups like ours in the
						Baltimore area!
						If you would like to get involved in the planning of this event, please complete the <a
							href="#">Interest Form</a>.
							<img src="/images/joyful_diverse.jpg" alt="Tech Unity Cookout">
					</p>

					<h3>Labor Council</h3>
					<p>
						We will be scheduling virtual events to bring together Tech personnel from around the world!
						Keep an eye out for these multilingual virtual events.
					</p>

					<h3>Survey Data Workshop (external)</h3>
					<p>
						Anthony Damaco, currently on his knowledge tour, will once again grace the Edgar Allan Poe room
						at the Enoch Pratt Main Branch,
						teaching a workshop on proper Public Data analysis in R.
						Be sure not to miss this enriching session! <a href="#">Sign up here</a>.

				<p>Thank you all for your continued support and participation. Together, we’ll shape a Tech Community
					that doesn’t suck.</p>
				<p>Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
